        <h3 class="langtopic">What is Javascript?</h3>
        <ul>
            <p class="learnpara"><b>Javascript(JS) is a lightweight interpreted  programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles. </b></p>
            <p class="learnpara"><b>JavaScript is a powerful programming language that can add interactivity to a website. It was invented by Brendan Eich.</b></p>
            <p class="learnpara"><b>JavaScript is versatile and beginner-friendly. With more experience, you'll be able to create games, animated 2D and 3D graphics, comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more!</b></p>
            <p class="learnpara"><b>JavaScript itself is relatively compact, yet very flexible. Developers have written a variety of tools on top of the core JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of functionality with minimum effort. These include:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li><p><b>Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) built into web browsers, providing functionality such as dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles; collecting and manipulating a video stream from a user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio samples.</b></p></li>
                <li><p><b>Third-party APIs that allow developers to incorporate functionality in sites from other content providers, such as Twitter or Facebook.</b></p></li>
                <li><p><b>Third-party frameworks and libraries that you can apply to HTML to accelerate the work of building sites and applications.</b></p></li>
            </ul>
            <p class="learnpara"><b>It's outside the scope of this article—as a light introduction to JavaScript—to present the details of how the core JavaScript language is different from the tools listed above. You can learn more in Coding Fever's JavaScript learning area, as well as in other parts of Coding Fever.</b></p>

        <h3 class="langtopic">A "Hello world!" example</h3>
        <ul>
            <p class="learnpara"><b>JavaScript is one of the most popular modern web technologies! As your JavaScript skills grow, your websites will enter a new dimension of power and creativity.</b></p>
            <p class="learnpara"><b>However, getting comfortable with JavaScript is more challenging than getting comfortable with HTML and CSS. You may have to start small, and progress gradually. To begin, let's examine how to add JavaScript to your page for creating a Hello world! example. (Hello world! is the standard for introductory programming examples.)</b></p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Go to your test site and create a new folder named scripts. Within the scripts folder, create a new text document called main.js, and save it.</b></li>
                <li><b>In your index.html file, enter this code on a new line, just before the closing body tag:</b></li>
                <li><b>This is doing the same job as the link element for CSS. It applies the JavaScript to the page, so it can have an effect on the HTML (along with the CSS, and anything else on the page).</b></li>
                <img src="./assets/ref images/js1.PNG" style="border-radius: 15px;" />
                <li><b>Add this code to the main.js file:</b></li>
                <img src="./assets/ref images/js2.PNG" style="border-radius: 15px;" />
                <li><b>Make sure the HTML and JavaScript files are saved. Then load index.html in your browser.</b></li>
            </ol>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <h3 class="langtopic">What happend in the example?</h3>
        <ul>
            <p class="learnpara"><b>The heading text changed to Hello world! using JavaScript. You did this by using a function called querySelector() to grab a reference to your heading, and then store it in a variable called myHeading. This is similar to what we did using CSS selectors. When you want to do something to an element, you need to select it first.</b></p>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <h3 class="langtopic">Variables</h3>
        <ul>
            <p class="learnpara"><b>Variables are containers that store values. You start by declaring a variable with the let keyword, followed by the name you give to the variable:</b></p>
            <img src="./assets/ref images/js3.PNG" style="border-radius: 15px;" />
            <p class="learnpara"><b>A semicolon at the end of a line indicates where a statement ends. It is only required when you need to separate statements on a single line. However, some people believe it's good practice to have semicolons at the end of each statement. There are other rules for when you should and shouldn't use semicolons. For more details, see Your Guide to Semicolons in JavaScript.</b></p>
            <p class="learnpara"><b>You can name a variable nearly anything, but there are some restrictions. (See this section about naming rules.) If you are unsure, you can check your variable name to see if it's valid.</b></p>
            <p class="learnpara"><b>JavaScript is case sensitive. This means myVariable is not the same as myvariable. If you have problems in your code, check the case!</b></p>
            <br>
            <p class="learnpara"><b>After declaring a variable, you can give it a value:</b></p>
            <img src="./assets/ref images/js4.PNG" style="border-radius: 15px;" />
            <p class="learnpara"><b>Also, you can do both these operations on the same line:</b></p>
            <img src="./assets/ref images/js5.PNG" style="border-radius: 15px;" />
            <p class="learnpara"><b>You retrieve the value by calling the variable name:</b></p>
            <img src="./assets/ref images/js6.PNG" style="border-radius: 15px;" />
            <p class="learnpara"><b>After assigning a value to a variable, you can change it later in the code:</b></p>
            <img src="./assets/ref images/js7.PNG" style="border-radius: 15px" />
            <p class="learnpara"><b>Note that variables may hold values that have different data types:</b></p>
            <img src="./assets/ref images/js8.PNG" style="border-radius: 15px;" />
            <p class="learnpara"><b>So why do we need variables? Variables are necessary to do anything interesting in programming. If values couldn't change, then you couldn't do anything dynamic, like personalize a greeting message or change an image displayed in an image gallery.</b></p>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="langtopic">Comments</h3>
        <ul>
            <p class="learnpara"><b>Comments are snippets of text that can be added along with code. The browser ignores text marked as comments. You can write comments in JavaScript just as you can in CSS:</b></p>
            <img src="./assets/ref images/js9.PNG" style="border-radius: 15px;" />
            <p class="learnpara"><b>If your comment contains no line breaks, it's an option to put it behind two slashes like this:</b></p>

        <h3 class="langtopic">Operators</h3>
        <ul>
            <p class="learnpara"><b>An operator is a mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values (or variables). In the following table, you can see some of the simplest operators, along with some examples to try in the JavaScript console.</b></p>
            <img src="./assets/ref images/js12.PNG" style="width:450px;border-radius: 15px;" />
            <p class="learnpara"><b>There are a lot more operators to explore, but this is enough for now.</b></p>
            <p class="learnpara"border-radius: 5px; padding-right: 10px; background-color: blue; color: yellow;"><b>NOTE : Mixing data types can lead to some strange results when performing calculations. Be careful that you are referring to your variables correctly, and getting the results you expect. For example, enter '35' + '25' into your console. Why don't you get the result you expected? Because the quote marks turn the numbers into strings, so you've ended up concatenating strings rather than adding numbers. If you enter 35 + 25 you'll get the total of the two numbers.</b></p>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <h3 class="langtopic">Conditionals</h3>
        <ul>
            <p class="learnpara"><b>Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. A very common form of conditionals is the if...else statement. For example:</b></p>
            <img src="./assets/ref images/js13.PNG" style="border-radius: 15px;" />
            <p class="learnpara"><b>The expression inside the if () is the test. This uses the strict equality operator (as described above) to compare the variable iceCream with the string chocolate to see if the two are equal. If this comparison returns true, the first block of code runs. If the comparison is not true, the second block of code—after the else statement—runs instead.</b></p>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <h3 class="langtopic">Functions</h3>
        <ul>
            <p class="learnpara"><b>Functions are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse. It's possible to define a body of code as a function that executes when you call the function name in your code. This is a good alternative to repeatedly writing the same code. You have already seen some uses of functions. For example:</b></p>
            <img src="./assets/ref images/js14.PNG" style="border-radius: 15px;" />
            <br><br>
            <img src="./assets/ref images/js15.PNG" style="border-radius: 15px;" />
            <p class="learnpara"><b>These functions, document.querySelector and alert, are built into the browser.</b></p>
            <br>
            <p class="learnpara"><B>You can also define your own functions. In the next example, we create a simple function which takes two numbers as arguments and multiplies them:</B></p>
            <img src="./assets/ref images/js16.PNG" style="border-radius: 15px;" />
            <p class="learnpara"><b>Try running this in the console; then test with several arguments. For example:</b></p>
            <img src="./assets/ref images/js17.PNG" style="border-radius: 15px;" />
        </ul>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <h3 class="langtopic">Events</h3>
        <ul>
            <p class="learnpara"><b>Real interactivity on a website requires event handlers. These are code structures that listen for activity in the browser, and run code in response. The most obvious example is handling the click event, which is fired by the browser when you click on something with your mouse. To demonstrate this, enter the following into your console, then click on the current webpage:</b></p>
            <img src="./assets/ref images/js17.PNG" style="border-radius: 15px;" /> 
            <p class="learnpara"><b>There are a number of ways to attach an event handler to an element. Here we select the <html> element. We then call its addEventListener() function, passing in the name of the event to listen to ('click') and a function to run when the event happens.</b></p>
        </ul>
